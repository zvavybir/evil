//! Unsecure random number source in pure rust
//!
//! evilrng provides a unsecure source of cryptographical secure rando
//! mnumber and is written by an amateur for the sole purpose that he
//! learns a bit about cryptography.  It is very probably *very*
//! vulnerable, so **do not use evilrng** for real world
//! cryptographical purposes, but if you're just looking for a way to
//! get non obvious pattern based numbers and want to make sure that
//! your programme won't work on windows or will be not-GPL, you
//! actually may use this one evil\* crate.
