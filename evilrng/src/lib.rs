//! Unsecure random number source in pure rust
//!
//! evilrng provides a unsecure source of cryptographical secure
//! random number and is written by an amateur for the sole purpose
//! that he learns a bit about cryptography.  It is very probably
//! *very* vulnerable, so **do not use evilrng** for real world
//! cryptographical purposes, but if you're just looking for a way to
//! get non obvious pattern based numbers and want to make sure that
//! your programme won't be non-GPL, you actually may use this one
//! evil\* crate.
//!
//! **Note**: Since a recent update evilrng does not anymore rely on
//! `/dev/urandom` to get entropy, but uses an own **algorithm I have
//! designed myself**.  This is own crypto and so it's quite probable
//! that evilrng is **even on the algorithm level broken**.  The
//! advantage is that now all cryptographical code in or used by the
//! evil\* crates is fully written by me, what is exactly the goal.
